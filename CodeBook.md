Overview

The goal of our analysis is to derive a tidy data set comprising the each variable’s mean and standard deviation associated with a study participant and the activities performed by that participant.   The tidyDataSet.txt is the result of analysis performed against data collected for the Human Activity Recognition Use Smartphones study.  The data set generated by this study and data set information can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.   

The tidyDataSet.txt comprise 68 feature variables documenting the mean and standard deviation of each participant’s activiites.  The README.md file documents the steps executed to cleanse and transform the study data into the tidy data set.
