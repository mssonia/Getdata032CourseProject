## Course project for get-data-032 Getting and Cleaning Data

To view the tidy data set, tidyDataSet.txt, generated by run_analysis.R, execute the following command:   
    
    read.table(‚ÄùtidyDataSet.txt", header=TRUE)
    
##Description

The run_analysis.R script executes the following steps to read, cleanse, and transform the UCI HAR Dataset (training and test data) into a tidy data set:

1. Sets the working directory where the features data is stored.  Read the features.txt file and stores data into local variable features.
2. Sets the working directory where training data (subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, Y_train.txt) is stored.  Reads the subject_train file and stores data to local variable trainingSubjects.  Reads the Y_train file and stores data in local variable trainingLabel.  Reads the X_train file and stores data in the local variable trainingSet.
2. Reads the training data files and Get training data 
2. Get test data.
3. Combine training and test data.
4. Rename columns with appropriate labels.
5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
6. Replace activity codes with descriptive activity names.
7. Creates tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
8. Write the tidy data set to a file for project submission.
